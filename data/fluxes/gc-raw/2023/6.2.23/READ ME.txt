During initial run on June 5th, the needle was bent and the batch wasn't correct from sample 33 to sample 95. 

Michael and I replaced the needle and started the batch back up STARTING FROM sample 33.

06022023_033 is the 1st standard, it may have slight variance.

I'm typing this on June 6th and the run is properly set up. 

This is more for record sake and just to make sure we all know that this unfortunately occured.
